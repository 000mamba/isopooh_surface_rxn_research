# isopooh_surface_rxn_research
Code for the investigation of ISOPOOH reactivity. The project specifically focuses on testing the relevance of recently proposed surface reactions with ISOPOOH that create urban condition products even in pristine conditions. The code here focuses on processing data and then modeling the reactions using already established reaction rates.
